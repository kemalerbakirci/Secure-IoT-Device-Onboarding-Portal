# Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Fundamentals for IoT

## 📋 **Overview**

Public Key Infrastructure forms the foundation of modern digital security. This guide explains PKI concepts specifically in the context of IoT device authentication and authorization.

## 🔑 **Core PKI Concepts**

### What is PKI?

PKI is a framework that enables secure communication through:
- **Digital certificates** that bind public keys to identities
- **Certificate Authorities (CAs)** that issue and manage certificates
- **Trust relationships** that allow parties to verify each other's identity

### Key Components

#### 1. Asymmetric Cryptography
- **Private Key**: Secret key known only to the device
- **Public Key**: Publicly available key derived from private key
- **Mathematical Relationship**: Data encrypted with one key can only be decrypted with the other

#### 2. Digital Certificates (X.509)
Structured documents containing:
- **Subject Information**: Device identity (Common Name, Organization)
- **Public Key**: Device's public key
- **Digital Signature**: CA's signature proving authenticity
- **Validity Period**: Start and end dates for certificate validity
- **Extensions**: Additional metadata (Subject Alternative Names, Key Usage)

#### 3. Certificate Authority (CA)
Trusted entity that:
- Issues certificates to devices
- Maintains certificate database
- Publishes Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs)
- Provides OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) responses

```

### Certificate Lifecycle Stages

1. **Key Generation**: Cryptographically secure random key pairs
2. **Certificate Request**: Device generates Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
3. **Certificate Issuance**: CA validates request and issues certificate
4. **Installation**: Certificate and private key stored securely on device
5. **Deployment**: Device uses certificate for authentication
6. **Renewal**: Certificate replaced before expiration
7. **Revocation**: Certificate invalidated if compromised

## 🔒 **Security Properties**

### Authentication
- **Proof of Identity**: Certificate proves device is who it claims to be
- **Non-Repudiation**: Cryptographic signatures prevent identity spoofing
- **Mutual Authentication**: Both client and server verify each other

### Integrity
- **Data Integrity**: Digital signatures detect tampering
- **Certificate Integrity**: CA signatures prevent certificate forgery

### Confidentiality
- **Key Exchange**: Public key cryptography enables secure key exchange
- **Session Encryption**: Establishes encrypted communication channels

## 📊 **Certificate Fields Explained**

### Standard X.509 Fields

| Field | Purpose | IoT Example |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Version** | X.509 format version | v3 (supports extensions) |
| **Serial Number** | Unique certificate identifier | Random 128-bit value |
| **Signature Algorithm** | Algorithm used to sign certificate | SHA256withRSA |
| **Issuer** | CA that issued certificate | CN=Secure IoT CA |
| **Validity** | Certificate validity period | 1 year from issuance |
| **Subject** | Certificate holder identity | CN=device-uuid-12345 |
| **Subject Public Key Info** | Device's public key | RSA 2048-bit key |
| **Extensions** | Additional certificate metadata | Subject Alternative Names |

### Important Extensions for IoT

#### Subject Alternative Names (SAN)
- Allows multiple identities in single certificate
- Common for IoT devices with multiple network interfaces
- Example: DNS names, IP addresses, URIs

#### Key Usage
- Specifies how the public key may be used
- Examples: Digital Signature, Key Encipherment
- Critical for preventing key misuse

#### Extended Key Usage
- Further refines key usage purposes
- Examples: Client Authentication, Server Authentication
- Important for mTLS authentication

## 🔄 **Certificate Validation Process**

### Step-by-Step Validation

1. **Certificate Chain Verification**
   - Verify each certificate in chain up to trusted root
   - Check that each certificate was signed by the next CA in chain

2. **Validity Period Check**
   - Ensure current time is within certificate validity period
   - Reject expired or not-yet-valid certificates

3. **Revocation Status Check**
   - Check Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
   - Or query Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)

4. **Subject Verification**
   - Verify certificate subject matches expected identity
   - Important for preventing man-in-the-middle attacks

5. **Key Usage Verification**
   - Ensure certificate key usage allows intended operation
   - Example: Client authentication for device certificates

### Common Validation Failures

| Failure | Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------|------------|
| **Expired Certificate** | Certificate past validity period | Renew certificate |
| **Invalid Signature** | Certificate chain broken or forged | Verify CA certificate |
| **Revoked Certificate** | Certificate in CRL or OCSP shows revoked | Issue new certificate |
| **Wrong Subject** | Certificate subject doesn't match expected identity | Verify device identity |
| **Invalid Key Usage** | Certificate doesn't allow required operation | Issue certificate with correct extensions |

## 🛡️ **PKI Security Best Practices**

### CA Security
- **Private Key Protection**: Store CA private key in Hardware Security Module (HSM)
- **Access Control**: Limit CA private key access to authorized personnel only
- **Audit Logging**: Log all certificate issuance and revocation operations
- **Key Ceremony**: Use multi-person authorization for sensitive CA operations

### Certificate Management
- **Short Lifetimes**: Use shorter certificate validity periods to limit exposure
- **Automated Renewal**: Implement automated certificate renewal processes
- **Secure Distribution**: Protect certificate distribution channels
- **Revocation Timeliness**: Revoke compromised certificates immediately

### Device Security
- **Hardware Protection**: Store private keys in secure hardware when possible
- **Key Non-Exportability**: Ensure private keys cannot be extracted from devices
- **Firmware Verification**: Verify device firmware integrity before certificate issuance
- **Secure Boot**: Use secure boot to ensure authentic firmware execution

## 📈 **Scalability Considerations**

### High-Volume Certificate Issuance
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple certificate requests simultaneously
- **Caching**: Cache intermediate certificates and CRLs
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute CA operations across multiple systems
- **Database Optimization**: Optimize certificate database for high throughput

### Certificate Distribution
- **Content Delivery Networks**: Use CDNs for certificate and CRL distribution
- **Delta CRLs**: Use incremental CRLs to reduce bandwidth
- **OCSP Stapling**: Cache OCSP responses to reduce validation latency

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting PKI Issues**

### Common Problems and Solutions

| Problem | Symptoms | Solution |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Time Synchronization** | Valid certificates rejected | Ensure accurate time on all systems |
| **Certificate Chain Issues** | Handshake failures | Verify complete certificate chain |
| **Revocation Check Failures** | Authentication delays | Implement proper CRL/OCSP infrastructure |
| **Key Mismatch** | Signature verification fails | Ensure private key matches certificate |

### Diagnostic Tools

```bash
# Verify certificate details
openssl x509 -in device.crt -text -noout

# Check certificate chain
openssl verify -CAfile ca.crt device.crt

# Test TLS connection
openssl s_client -connect broker:8883 -cert device.crt -key device.key

# Check certificate validity dates
openssl x509 -in device.crt -dates -noout
```
